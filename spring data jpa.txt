lombok dependencie helps to reduce boilerplate code




Fetch types:
-eager and lazy. By default it is lazy.
lazy:
-if you fetch the courseMaterial, it will not fetch the course too only if you use it(for example use course field from courseMaterial)

eager:
-if you fetch the courseMaterial, it will automatically fetch the course too.




On @ManyToMany relationship between two tables will create a third table.
for example you have ManyToMany between a student and a course, so we need a table to represent this particular relation.
